# starbucks_capstone_project
This project is one of the capstone projects available in Udacity Data Science nanodegree program. The data contains simulated data that mimics customer behavior on the Starbucks rewards mobile app. Once every few days, Starbucks sends out an offer to users of the mobile app. An offer can be merely an advertisement for a drink or an actual offer such as a discount or BOGO (buy one get one free). Some users might not receive any offer during certain weeks. Not all users receive the same offer, and every offer has a validity period before the offer expires. Offers might be viewed or not, and completed or not. The offer is completed when its requirements are met before the end of the offer duration.

# Project Overview:
The purpose of this project to complete an exploratory analysis to determine which demographic group responds best to which offer type. We will also create and compare different predictive models to predict whether a customer offer combination will be successful
